Thank you for considering contributing to CoolCline! This guide will help you understand how to participate in project development.

## Git Workflow

We follow the standard `gitflow` workflow (recommended):

Remote and local branches:

- `main` branch: Stable release versions
- `develop` branch: Latest development version

Local-only branches:

- `feature/*` branches: New feature development
- `docs/*` branches: Documentation updates
- `hotfix/*` branches: Bug fixes for main branch
- `devfix/*` branches: Bug fixes for develop branch
- `release/*` branches: Release preparation

## Fork the `coolcline` Repository

- Gitee: [https://gitee.com/coolcline/coolcline.git](https://gitee.com/coolcline/coolcline.git)
- GitHub: [https://github.com/coolcline/coolcline.git](https://github.com/coolcline/coolcline.git)

Click the `fork` button to fork the repository to your Gitee or GitHub account.

## Clone the Repository

> Note: The develop branch contains the latest version, while the main branch is the release version of the develop branch:

```bash
# Execute in command line
# gitee
git clone https://gitee.com/<your-gitee-username>/coolcline.git
# github
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/coolcline.git
```

## Prepare Development Branch in VSCode:

```bash
# Execute in command line
cd coolcline # Enter project directory
code coolcline # Open project

# Continue in command line or VSCode terminal
git checkout develop # Switch to develop branch
git pull origin develop # Pull latest develop branch

# Create branch like: `feature/<your-feature-name>`, `docs/<your-docs-name>`, `hotfix/<your-hotfix-name>`, `devfix/<your-devfix-name>`, `release/<your-release-name>`
git checkout -b feature/xx develop # Create feature branch from develop
```

## Setup Development Environment

> bun is currently more popular than npm, we recommend using bun to install dependencies. Note: if you switch to npm, please modify the commands in `package.json`.

1. Install bun

    > If you don't have bun yet, please install it first. bun website: [https://bun.sh/](https://bun.sh/)
    >
    > macOS install bun: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
    >
    > windows install bun: `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"`

2. Install dependencies (required):

```bash
# Execute in root directory to install all dependencies
# 'all' will install dependencies for both root and webview-ui/ directories
bun run install:all
```

## Debugging

1. Run tests:

```bash
# Execute in root directory
bun run test # Note: not `bun test`
```

2. Start development environment:
   Press `F5` (or click `Run` -> `Start Debugging` in VSCode top menu) to launch a new VSCode window with the extension loaded.

    > Note: If you encounter build issues, you may need to install the [esbuild problem matchers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.esbuild-problem-matchers).

## Contributing Guidelines

Anyone can contribute code to CoolCline, but we ask that you follow these guidelines:

1. **Keep Pull Requests Focused**

    - Limit PRs to a single feature or bug fix
    - Split larger changes into smaller, related PRs
    - Break changes into logical commits that can be reviewed independently

2. **Code Quality**

```bash
    # Before submitting:

    # Execute in root directory to check code style
    bun run lint # Address any ESLint warnings or errors before submitting
    # Execute in root directory to format code
    bun run format # Format code with Prettier

    # Follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety
```

3. **Testing**

    - Add tests for new features
    - Run `bun run test` to ensure all tests pass
    - Update existing tests if your changes affect them
    - Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

4. **Commit Guidelines**

    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
    - Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "hotfix:", "devfix:", "release:", "docs:")
    - Reference relevant issues in commits using #issue-number

5. **Before Submitting**

    - Rebase your branch on the latest develop branch
    - Ensure your branch builds successfully
    - Double-check all tests are passing (`bun run test`, note: not `bun test`)
    - Review your changes for any debugging code or console logs

6. **Pull Request Description**
    - Clearly describe what your changes do
    - Include steps to test the changes
    - List any breaking changes
    - Add screenshots for UI changes
